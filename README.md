# Innovation AI Chatbot Dataset Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains an analytical project based on the **Innovation AI Chatbot Dataset**, which records user profiles, interaction sessions, question-level evaluations, and system events generated during AI-driven interview processes. The project focuses on understanding data structure, user behavior, and outcome-related patterns through exploratory and statistical analysis.

All analyses are conducted in **R** with an emphasis on clarity, reproducibility, and sound analytical reasoning.

### Repository Overview  
This repository was created by **[Songxiu Yukihira](mailto:songxiuyukihira@innovation-ai.co)**, Engineering Manager at **Innovation AI**, to serve as a centralized workspace for **Data Analyst interns**.  

### Purpose  
- Store and version-control your **code, experiments, and project work**.  
- Maintain a structured record of your progress.  
- Facilitate collaboration and feedback within the team.

## Dataset
The dataset is organized into multiple related tables representing different components of the interview workflow, such as:
- User-level information
- Session-level metadata and outcomes
- Question-level performance records
- System interaction logs

A detailed **codebook/data dictionary** is provided and should be reviewed before starting any analysis to ensure correct interpretation of variables.

---

## Project Goals
- Gain familiarity with the dataset structure and table relationships  
- Assess data quality and identify limitations  
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using descriptive statistics and visualization  
- Explore relationships between variables to inform further analysis  
- Produce reproducible and interpretable analytical outputs  

---

## Analysis Workflow
1. **Codebook Review**
   - Understand variable definitions, data types, and intended usage  

2. **Data Validation**
   - Check for missing values, duplicates, and basic data consistency  

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Summary statistics (means, medians, distributions)  
   - Visual exploration (histograms, box plots, scatter plots)  
   - Correlation analysis to identify relationships  

4. **Reporting**
   - Document findings with clear plots and concise interpretations  

---

**Best Practices**:  
- Use **clear, descriptive filenames** (e.g., `eda_customer_segment.ipynb`).  
- Document your code with **comments** and **READMEs** in each subfolder.  
- Regularly **commit changes** with meaningful messages.
