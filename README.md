# Innovation AI Chatbot Dataset Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains an analytical project based on the **Innovation AI Chatbot Dataset**, which records user profiles, interaction sessions, question-level evaluations, and system events generated during AI-driven interview processes. The project focuses on understanding data structure, user behavior, and outcome-related patterns through exploratory and statistical analysis.

All analyses are conducted in **R** with an emphasis on clarity, reproducibility, and sound analytical reasoning.

---

## Dataset
The dataset is organized into multiple related tables representing different components of the interview workflow, such as:
- User-level information
- Session-level metadata and outcomes
- Question-level performance records
- System interaction logs

A detailed **codebook/data dictionary** is provided and should be reviewed before starting any analysis to ensure correct interpretation of variables.

---

## Project Goals
- Gain familiarity with the dataset structure and table relationships  
- Assess data quality and identify limitations  
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using descriptive statistics and visualization  
- Explore relationships between variables to inform further analysis  
- Produce reproducible and interpretable analytical outputs  

---

## Analysis Workflow
1. **Codebook Review**
   - Understand variable definitions, data types, and intended usage  

2. **Data Validation**
   - Check for missing values, duplicates, and basic data consistency  

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Summary statistics (means, medians, distributions)  
   - Visual exploration (histograms, box plots, scatter plots)  
   - Correlation analysis to identify relationships  

4. **Reporting**
   - Document findings with clear plots and concise interpretations  

---

## Outputs
- Reproducible R scripts  
- RMarkdown or Quarto reports  
- EDA visualizations with written explanations  
- Summary insights to guide future analysis or experimentation  

---

## Tools
- **Language:** R  
- **Key packages:** tidyverse, ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, readxl  
- **Reporting:** RMarkdown / Quarto  

---

## Reproducibility
All results should be generated directly from raw data using code.  
No manual data manipulation or figure editing is permitted.
