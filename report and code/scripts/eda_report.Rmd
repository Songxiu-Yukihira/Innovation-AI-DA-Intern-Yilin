## Descriptive statistics

```{r , message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
rm(list = ls())  # Clear workspace

library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(janitor)
library(skimr)
```

Data Load: set the data path and view the names of all sheets from the EXCEL table.
```{r load data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
data_path = "../data/ai_interview_dataset_1129.xlsx"

sheets <- excel_sheets(data_path)
print("Sheets in the dataset:")
sheets           # List all sheet names
```

Read each sheet from the excel file:
```{r read data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
data_list <- list()
for (sheet in sheets) {
  data_list[[sheet]] <- read_excel(data_path, sheet = sheet)
}
```

Dataset Overview: summarises the basic structure of each dataset, including the number of rows, columns, variable names, and missing rate.
```{r overview data, results='asis'}
# Overview of each sheet
overview <- list()
for (sheet in sheets) {
    df <- data_list[[sheet]]
    overview[[sheet]] <- tibble(
        rows = nrow(df),
        cols = ncol(df),
        col_names = paste(names(df), collapse = ", "),
        missing_rate = sum(is.na(df)) / (nrow(df) * ncol(df))
)
}
print("Sheet overview:")
overview
```
From the overview, we can see that the general size, variable name and completeness of each table. And we can see that the missing rate of the "technical_questions" table is 0.18, which indicates that this table has missing values.


Numeric Variable Summary: select only numeric variables and analyse numeric variables using descriptive statistics.
```{r numeric variable summary, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
summary_list <- list()
for (sheet in sheets) {
    df <- data_list[[sheet]]

    # Select only numeric columns for summary
    numeric_df <- df %>% select(where(is.numeric)) 
     # Print sheet name as a header
    cat("\n## Sheet:", sheet, "\n")   
    # Generates information such as mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and missing values.
    if (ncol(numeric_df) > 0) {
        summary_list[[sheet]] <- skim(numeric_df)
        print(summary_list[[sheet]])
    }
    else{
        cat("No numeric columns to summarize in this sheet.\n")
    }
}
```
The results include mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and missing value information for each numeric variable.

Suspicious points: 
Sheet users
1. From the chart, we can see that the highest value of total_experience_years is 8.5. But the codebook specifies that the upper limit for the early-career focus is 5 years.
2. The project_count is at its maximum of 12, with an average of 2.5, which is above the normal range.
3. The maximum value of resume_feedback_length_tokens is 766. We can conduct a visual analysis of outliers to determine if it is reasonable.

Sheet technical_questions 
1. The percentage of statistical_depth's missing values is extremely high. But the codebook indicates that [DS-SPECIFIC COLUMNS] (NULL for SDE track). Therefore, this absence might be reasonable due to the issue with the SDE track, and it is not a data error.
2. The highest value of time_to_answer_sec is 1409. But the codebook specifies that the range of this is from 15s to 360s. 



## Data visualization

Create Image: Create histograms for each numeric column in each sheet
```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
for (sheet in sheets) {
    df <- data_list[[sheet]]
    numeric_df <- df %>% select(where(is.numeric))
    if (ncol(numeric_df) > 0) {
        for (col_name in names(numeric_df)){
            p.hist <- ggplot(numeric_df, aes_string(x = col_name)) + 
                geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = "blue", color = "black") +
                labs(title = paste("Histogram of", col_name, "in sheet", sheet), x = col_name, y = "Frequency")
            print(p.hist)
        }
} }
```
